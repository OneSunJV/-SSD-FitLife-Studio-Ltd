To setup the database (only needs to be done once, unless you delete the SystemDatabase.db file):
- Setup the database and its tables by running `python database/create_database.py`
- Seed the database with some initial data by running `python database/seed_db.py`

To run the application:
- `python main.py`

(Note all commands should be ran from the project root)
